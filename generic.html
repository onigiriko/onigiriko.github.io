								<h2>Well, Hello there.</h2>
								<p>"Onigiri" is a Japanese word, meaning "Riceball". There is nothing special about that name, it is an ordinary meal just like I IRL am an ordinary person. There is nothing special about me. </p>
								<p>I am still a university student and have no idea where my life is headed to, but I try to enjoy the little things in my life. I hate to work on my days off. Games and Anime are my favourite way of escapism, I mostly play Genshin Impact and Apex Legends. I'm an avid K-ON! fan and I love every single thing about that show, please watch if you haven't. Music is best way I like to relax after a hectic day, I don't have a favourite genre but lately I have developed a liking to music from late 90s and early 00s. I don't meet a lot of people IRL but discord gave me a lot of friends, people I treasure having in my life. I don't have a life outside of the internet and I like to meet and talk to new people on internet and exchange interests with. I'm quite active on anilist and discord and DMs are always welcome.</p>
